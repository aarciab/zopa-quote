### Additional Comments ###

1) Sorry I tried to create an executable file but I dont have a Windows machine to test it. Please let me know if that not an issue, if it is, I will find one this week of mount an image to test it.

2) I am sending you the .exe that I created, the URL for GitHub and also the whole project zipped.

3) Maybe I use a locomotor machine to carry out a simple job (refering to Spring Batch), but I did not wanted to give you guys a simple solution ;).
